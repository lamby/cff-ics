DESCRIPTION:Duration: 105 mins (1h45m)\n\nThe best crossover between Norma
 l People and Fleabag? Andrew Haigh’s new film is one for the ages\, with
  Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal tying past\, present\, and future in a Londo
 n high rise. Apparently the only two people there\, Adam and Harry become 
 close just by virtue of proximity. All of Us Strangers is a fascinating wh
 irlpool of a film\, part ghost-story\, part memory piece\, but ultimately 
 it's an exploration of the power of love. Humans are flawed\, scarred by t
 heir past\, but if they only meet each other things would be better\, righ
 t? Based on Taichi Yamada's “Strangers”\, our Closing Film will haunt 
 you for a long time.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/film/2023

  passing some years ago has deeply affected the pair\, and in a search for
  comfort\, Linda asks her mum to make chicken and peppers for dinner. Soun

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 135 mins (2h15m)\n\nFREE SCREENING! \nAfter the succ
 ess of Ladybird\, Greta Gerwig cemented her place as a leading director of
  her generation with her fresh adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic c
 hildren's book. We follow the dynamic March sisters as they grow up togeth
 er in American Civil War era Massachusetts. Wonderfully played by an excep
 tionally strong cast\, Saoirse Ronan plays headstrong Jo and she is suppor
 ted by Emma Watson (Meg)\, Eliza Scanlen (Beth) and a revelatory Florence 
 Pugh who reinvents the character of Amy for a new generation. Gerwig's fil
 m is a classic for the ages and not to be missed.\n\nFor more fun\, join u

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 92 mins (1h32m)\n\nThis luscious classic turns 30 th
 is year and it is more resplendent than ever. Tilda Swinton takes us on a 
 journey through Elizabethan England\, in time\, through gender\, starting 
 as the young Nobleman Orlando to then one morning wake up a woman. Sally P
 otter bases her most acclaimed film on Virginia Woolf’s eponymous novel 
 and the final product dazzles with its affective visual style and simmerin
 g meditation on death. Lady or Gentleman\, Orlando remains a queer staple 
 that will bring literary lovers\, Swinton stans\, and cinephiles together 
 around the fire. A spectacle\, a joy\, a profound piece of cine-philosophy
 .\nSally Potter also considered Michael Powell a dear friend. She has shar
 ed how Powell and Pressburger’s work has influenced and reflected her ow
 n perspectives on identity and history and wrote a dedication to Michael a
 t the end of Orlando.\n\nPart of Powell + Pressburger's Dreamweaving Cinem

  death a decade later. Working with approximately 15\,000 hours of materia
 l that’s a mixture of home movies\, archival racetrack footage and never
 -before-seen backroom videos of drivers’ briefings\, it’s an intimate 
 documentary of an individual who was just as compelling out of his race ca

 e\, in a far away swamp\, there lived an ogre named Shrek… and animated 
 cinema history was born. Packed with irreverence that turned the fairy tal

 mances from the likes of Mike Myers\, Cameron Diaz\, and the inimitable Ed
 die Murphy\, a banging soundtrack – Smash Mouth’s ‘All Star’ and t
 he cover of ‘I'm a Believer’ are iconic – and a simple\, but heartfe
 lt message on the importance of companionship. Add in the ambitious CG sty
 lisation and a consistent hit rate of gags\, and it’s little wonder why 
 Shrek still holds up two decades after we were first introduced to his swa
 mp.\n\nFor more fun\, join us in the cinema restaurant an hour before each

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 134 mins (2h14m)\n\nOriginal Title: The Pot Au Feu\n
 Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel star in Vietnamese-French director Tr
 an Anh Hung’s culinary historical drama. The braised-beef dish of the fi
 lm’s title should alert you to the sensory delights delivered by the Can
 nes Winner for Best Director. Eugenie (Binoche) is a cook hired by gourmet
  Dodin Bouffant (Magimel)\, their harmonious\, loving relationship irreduc
 ible to employer-employee. Unsurprisingly\, every meal is a work of art sh
 own in long takes and close-ups. In The Pot Au Feu\, cooking is an artform
  and cinema is a slave to that artform.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgefilmfestiv

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 136 mins (2h16m)\n\nPowell and Pressburger’s vivid
 \, operatic masterpiece\, The Tales of Hoffman\, tells the story of the lo
 ves and losses of unlucky student Hoffman. Despite dividing critics upon i
 ts release\, the picture nevertheless won the Silver Bear at Berlin. Powel
 l and Pressburger also gained the approval of Cecil B. DeMille\, who decla
 red\, ‘For the first time in my life I was treated to Grand Opera where 
 the beauty\, power and scope of the music were equally matched with the vi
 sual presentation’. Reuniting much of the team behind their well-loved c
 lassic\, The Red Shoes\, this is a cinematic spectacle which needs to be e
 njoyed on the big screen\n\nPart of Powell + Pressburger's Dreamweaving Ci

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 86 mins (1h26m)\n\nMost directors start with somethi
 ng relatively small scale for their first film. Asif Kapadia is not like m
 ost directors. Set in Feudal India\, his striking debut centres on Lafcadi
 a (the late\, great Irfan Khan)\, a leader of warriors commanded by a crue
 l local lord who has a vision that inspires him to renounce his life of vi
 olence. But that’s easier said than done\, and soon the hunter becomes t
 he hunted. The cinematography by Roman Osin is frequently beautiful\, and 
 the old-fashioned\, visual-heavy storytelling is no less bold and epic eve
 n with its 86 minute running time.\nShowing with THE SHEEP THIEF\, ASIF KA

 tor Carol Morley to Cambridge for our 42nd Opening Night! \nTypist Artist 
 Pirate King is a touching tribute to Sunderland-born artist Audrey Amiss. 
 \nCarol Morley takes us on a heart-warming road trip that captures the mem
 ories\, locations and nostalgia that influenced Audrey’s art and writing
 . The film first finds Audrey (Monica Dolan) going through the archives of
  her life’s work\, feeling driven to return home to put on a final exhib
 ition. Her psychiatric nurse Sandra (Kelly Macdonald) gets roped into the 
 trip\, and they encounter strangers and new friends on the road.\n\nhttps:
