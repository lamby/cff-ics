 nRelease year: {film['year']}\n\nThe best crossover between Normal People 
 and Fleabag? Andrew Haigh’s new film is one for the ages\, with Andrew S
 cott and Paul Mescal tying past\, present\, and future in a London high ri
 se. Apparently the only two people there\, Adam and Harry become close jus
 t by virtue of proximity. All of Us Strangers is a fascinating whirlpool o
 f a film\, part ghost-story\, part memory piece\, but ultimately it's an e
 xploration of the power of love. Humans are flawed\, scarred by their past
 \, but if they only meet each other things would be better\, right? Based 
 on Taichi Yamada's “Strangers”\, our Closing Film will haunt you for a
  long time.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/film/2023/all-of-u

 inda and her mother Paulette have pushed their relationship to the limit. 
 The pain of Linda's father passing some years ago has deeply affected the 
 pair\, and in a search for comfort\, Linda asks her mum to make chicken an
 d peppers for dinner. Sounds pretty simple\, right? In their quest to make
  the dish\, a series of brilliant and ridiculous events occur\, including 
 a supermarket strike in France\, a chicken-stealing-police chase\, and a w
 atermelon fight. Rich with laughter\, and bursting with colour and calamit
 y\, this story sparks an essential conversation about grief and joy in chi

 Release year: {film['year']}\n\nAdapting an Ottessa Moshfegh novel is a ch
 allenge\, but William Oldroyd (Lady Macbeth) is up to the task. With its H
 itchcockian masterstrokes\, Eileen will keep you on your toes. A psychosex
 ual drama that boils with anger and fascination alike\, the source of whic
 h is none other than the titular Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie). Her dull days
  in a prison facility are suddenly brightened up by the presence of Rebecc
 a (the ever-magnetic Anne Hathaway)\, her soft spoken\, educated voice\, h
 er elegant attire\, the way she carries herself in a world that is obvious
 ly not hers\, all of this is simply mesmerising.\n\nAlso playing at:\n•

 nRelease year: {film['year']}\n\nPLASTIC FANTASTIC reveals not only the sh
 ocking scale of the plastics crisis but offers insights into the hidden st
 ructures and systematic failures of a business model which works against r
 eal change and is actually driving increased plastics production. The film
  makes clear we have to understand these complexities if we are to find so
 lutions. With a flair for visual storytelling\, this film shows how things
  could be so much better and offers the possibility of hope if only we hav
 e the courage to act. This is a return to the Festival for director Isa Wi
 llinger\, whose film HI\, AI was a huge success in 2019.Part of Environmen

 Release year: {film['year']}\n\nFREE SCREENING! Once upon a time\, in a fa
 r away swamp\, there lived an ogre named Shrek… and animated cinema hist
 ory was born. Packed with irreverence that turned the fairy tale genre on 
 its head\, this Dreamworks classic has a bevy of winning performances from
  the likes of Mike Myers\, Cameron Diaz\, and the inimitable Eddie Murphy\
 , a banging soundtrack – Smash Mouth’s ‘All Star’ and the cover of
  ‘I'm a Believer’ are iconic – and a simple\, but heartfelt message 
 on the importance of companionship. Add in the ambitious CG stylisation an
 d a consistent hit rate of gags\, and it’s little wonder why Shrek still
  holds up two decades after we were first introduced to his swamp.For more
  fun\, join us in the cinema restaurant an hour before each family screeni

 Release year: {film['year']}\n\nMost directors start with something relati
 vely small scale for their first film. Asif Kapadia is not like most direc
 tors. Set in Feudal India\, his striking debut centres on Lafcadia (the la
 te\, great Irfan Khan)\, a leader of warriors commanded by a cruel local l
 ord who has a vision that inspires him to renounce his life of violence. B
 ut that’s easier said than done\, and soon the hunter becomes the hunted
 . The cinematography by Roman Osin is frequently beautiful\, and the old-f
 ashioned\, visual-heavy storytelling is no less bold and epic even with it
