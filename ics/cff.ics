 w film is one for the ages\, with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal tying past\

  Us Strangers is a fascinating whirlpool of a film\, part ghost-story\, pa
 rt memory piece\, but ultimately it's an exploration of the power of love.
  Humans are flawed\, scarred by their past\, but if they only meet each ot
 her things would be better\, right? Based on Taichi Yamada's “Strangers

 Italian-French duo Chiara Malta and Sébastien Laudenbach present this gor
 geous\, heartfelt and hilarious animation about love\, nostalgia and commu
 nity\, which won the Cristal top prize at the Annecy Film Festival. After 
 another family squabble\, eight-year-old Linda and her mother Paulette hav
 e pushed their relationship to the limit. The pain of Linda's father passi
 ng some years ago has deeply affected the pair\, and in a search for comfo
 rt\, Linda asks her mum to make chicken and peppers for dinner. Sounds pre
 tty simple\, right? In their quest to make the dish\, a series of brillian
 t and ridiculous events occur\, including a supermarket strike in France\,
  a chicken-stealing-police chase\, and a watermelon fight. Rich with laugh
 ter\, and bursting with colour and calamity\, this story sparks an essenti
 al conversation about grief and joy in childhood.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge

 nFREE SCREENING! After the success of Ladybird\, Greta Gerwig cemented her
  place as a leading director of her generation with her fresh adaptation o
 f Louisa May Alcott's classic children's book. We follow the dynamic March
  sisters as they grow up together in American Civil War era Massachusetts.

 headstrong Jo and she is supported by Emma Watson (Meg)\, Eliza Scanlen (B
 eth) and a revelatory Florence Pugh who reinvents the character of Amy for
  a new generation. Gerwig's film is a classic for the ages and not to be m

 This luscious classic turns 30 this year and it is more resplendent than e
 ver. Tilda Swinton takes us on a journey through Elizabethan England\, in 
 time\, through gender\, starting as the young Nobleman Orlando to then one
  morning wake up a woman. Sally Potter bases her most acclaimed film on Vi
 rginia Woolf’s eponymous novel and the final product dazzles with its af
 fective visual style and simmering meditation on death. Lady or Gentleman\
 , Orlando remains a queer staple that will bring literary lovers\, Swinton
  stans\, and cinephiles together around the fire. A spectacle\, a joy\, a 
 profound piece of cine-philosophy.Sally Potter also considered Michael Pow
 ell a dear friend. She has shared how Powell and Pressburger’s work has 
 influenced and reflected her own perspectives on identity and history and 
 wrote a dedication to Michael at the end of Orlando.Part of Powell + Press

 imately 15\,000 hours of material that’s a mixture of home movies\, arch

  briefings\, it’s an intimate documentary of an individual who was just

 FREE SCREENING! Once upon a time\, in a far away swamp\, there lived an og
 re named Shrek… and animated cinema history was born. Packed with irreve
 rence that turned the fairy tale genre on its head\, this Dreamworks class
 ic has a bevy of winning performances from the likes of Mike Myers\, Camer
 on Diaz\, and the inimitable Eddie Murphy\, a banging soundtrack – Smash
  Mouth’s ‘All Star’ and the cover of ‘I'm a Believer’ are iconic
  – and a simple\, but heartfelt message on the importance of companionsh
 ip. Add in the ambitious CG stylisation and a consistent hit rate of gags\
 , and it’s little wonder why Shrek still holds up two decades after we w
 ere first introduced to his swamp.For more fun\, join us in the cinema res
 taurant an hour before each family screening for arts and crafts.\n\nhttps

 nPowell and Pressburger’s vivid\, operatic masterpiece\, The Tales of Ho
 ffman\, tells the story of the loves and losses of unlucky student Hoffman
 . Despite dividing critics upon its release\, the picture nevertheless won
  the Silver Bear at Berlin. Powell and Pressburger also gained the approva
 l of Cecil B. DeMille\, who declared\, ‘For the first time in my life I 
 was treated to Grand Opera where the beauty\, power and scope of the music
  were equally matched with the visual presentation’. Reuniting much of t
 he team behind their well-loved classic\, The Red Shoes\, this is a cinema
 tic spectacle which needs to be enjoyed on the big screenPart of Powell +

 Most directors start with something relatively small scale for their first
  film. Asif Kapadia is not like most directors. Set in Feudal India\, his 
 striking debut centres on Lafcadia (the late\, great Irfan Khan)\, a leade
 r of warriors commanded by a cruel local lord who has a vision that inspir
 es him to renounce his life of violence. But that’s easier said than don
 e\, and soon the hunter becomes the hunted. The cinematography by Roman Os
 in is frequently beautiful\, and the old-fashioned\, visual-heavy storytel
 ling is no less bold and epic even with its 86 minute running time.Showing
