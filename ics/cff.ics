 n\nThe best crossover between Normal People and Fleabag? Andrew Haigh’s 
 new film is one for the ages\, with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal tying pas
 t\, present\, and future in a London high rise. Apparently the only two pe
 ople there\, Adam and Harry become close just by virtue of proximity. All 
 of Us Strangers is a fascinating whirlpool of a film\, part ghost-story\, 
 part memory piece\, but ultimately it's an exploration of the power of lov
 e. Humans are flawed\, scarred by their past\, but if they only meet each 
 other things would be better\, right? Based on Taichi Yamada's “Stranger
 s”\, our Closing Film will haunt you for a long time.\n\nhttps://www.cam

 ave pushed their relationship to the limit. The pain of Linda's father pas
 sing some years ago has deeply affected the pair\, and in a search for com

 retty simple\, right? In their quest to make the dish\, a series of brilli
 ant and ridiculous events occur\, including a supermarket strike in France
 \, a chicken-stealing-police chase\, and a watermelon fight. Rich with lau
 ghter\, and bursting with colour and calamity\, this story sparks an essen

 \nAdapting an Ottessa Moshfegh novel is a challenge\, but William Oldroyd 
 (Lady Macbeth) is up to the task. With its Hitchcockian masterstrokes\, Ei
 leen will keep you on your toes. A psychosexual drama that boils with ange
 r and fascination alike\, the source of which is none other than the titul
 ar Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie). Her dull days in a prison facility are sudd
 enly brightened up by the presence of Rebecca (the ever-magnetic Anne Hath
 away)\, her soft spoken\, educated voice\, her elegant attire\, the way sh
 e carries herself in a world that is obviously not hers\, all of this is s
 imply mesmerising.\n\nAlso playing on:\n• Tue 24 October\, 08:45 PM (Scr

 n time\, through gender\, starting as the young Nobleman Orlando to then o
 ne morning wake up a woman. Sally Potter bases her most acclaimed film on 
 Virginia Woolf’s eponymous novel and the final product dazzles with its 
 affective visual style and simmering meditation on death. Lady or Gentlema
 n\, Orlando remains a queer staple that will bring literary lovers\, Swint
 on stans\, and cinephiles together around the fire. A spectacle\, a joy\, 
 a profound piece of cine-philosophy.Sally Potter also considered Michael P
 owell a dear friend. She has shared how Powell and Pressburger’s work ha
 s influenced and reflected her own perspectives on identity and history an
 d wrote a dedication to Michael at the end of Orlando.Part of Powell + Pre

 roximately 15\,000 hours of material that’s a mixture of home movies\, a

 \nRomantic comedies can be a little bit formulaic\, but actor-turned-direc
 tor Randall Park’s feature debut is anything but. Adapted from Adrian To
 mine’s 2007 graphic novel of the same name\, it focuses on Ben (Justin H
 . Min)\, a struggling filmmaker who is left to his own devices when his gi
 rlfriend Miko (Ally Maki) moves from their Californian apartment to New Yo
 rk for a three month internship. What follows is not only frequently funny
  – Joy Ride’s Sherry Cola scores many laughs as Alice\, Ben’s queer 
 (and blunt) best friend – but also an absorbing character study that off
 ers biting insights on the value of Asian American comedies. There are few
  shortcomings to be found here.\n\nAlso playing on:\n• Wed 25 October\,

 \nRomantic comedies can be a little bit formulaic\, but actor-turned-direc
 tor Randall Park’s feature debut is anything but. Adapted from Adrian To
 mine’s 2007 graphic novel of the same name\, it focuses on Ben (Justin H
 . Min)\, a struggling filmmaker who is left to his own devices when his gi
 rlfriend Miko (Ally Maki) moves from their Californian apartment to New Yo
 rk for a three month internship. What follows is not only frequently funny
  – Joy Ride’s Sherry Cola scores many laughs as Alice\, Ben’s queer 
 (and blunt) best friend – but also an absorbing character study that off
 ers biting insights on the value of Asian American comedies. There are few
  shortcomings to be found here.\n\nAlso playing on:\n• Mon 23 October\,

 \nFREE SCREENING! Once upon a time\, in a far away swamp\, there lived an 
 ogre named Shrek… and animated cinema history was born. Packed with irre
 verence that turned the fairy tale genre on its head\, this Dreamworks cla
 ssic has a bevy of winning performances from the likes of Mike Myers\, Cam
 eron Diaz\, and the inimitable Eddie Murphy\, a banging soundtrack – Sma
 sh Mouth’s ‘All Star’ and the cover of ‘I'm a Believer’ are icon
 ic – and a simple\, but heartfelt message on the importance of companion
 ship. Add in the ambitious CG stylisation and a consistent hit rate of gag
 s\, and it’s little wonder why Shrek still holds up two decades after we
  were first introduced to his swamp.For more fun\, join us in the cinema r
 estaurant an hour before each family screening for arts and crafts.\n\nhtt

 Hoffman\, tells the story of the loves and losses of unlucky student Hoffm
 an. Despite dividing critics upon its release\, the picture nevertheless w
 on the Silver Bear at Berlin. Powell and Pressburger also gained the appro
 val of Cecil B. DeMille\, who declared\, ‘For the first time in my life 
 I was treated to Grand Opera where the beauty\, power and scope of the mus
 ic were equally matched with the visual presentation’. Reuniting much of

 \nMost directors start with something relatively small scale for their fir
 st film. Asif Kapadia is not like most directors. Set in Feudal India\, hi
 s striking debut centres on Lafcadia (the late\, great Irfan Khan)\, a lea
 der of warriors commanded by a cruel local lord who has a vision that insp
 ires him to renounce his life of violence. But that’s easier said than d
 one\, and soon the hunter becomes the hunted. The cinematography by Roman 
 Osin is frequently beautiful\, and the old-fashioned\, visual-heavy storyt
 elling is no less bold and epic even with its 86 minute running time.Showi
