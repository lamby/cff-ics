DESCRIPTION:Duration: 105 mins (1h45m)\nScreen: 1\n\nThe best crossover be
 tween Normal People and Fleabag? Andrew Haigh’s new film is one for the 
 ages\, with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal tying past\, present\, and future
  in a London high rise. Apparently the only two people there\, Adam and Ha
 rry become close just by virtue of proximity. All of Us Strangers is a fas
 cinating whirlpool of a film\, part ghost-story\, part memory piece\, but 
 ultimately it's an exploration of the power of love. Humans are flawed\, s
 carred by their past\, but if they only meet each other things would be be
 tter\, right? Based on Taichi Yamada's “Strangers”\, our Closing Film 
 will haunt you for a long time.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.u

 nship to the limit. The pain of Linda's father passing some years ago has 
 deeply affected the pair\, and in a search for comfort\, Linda asks her mu
 m to make chicken and peppers for dinner. Sounds pretty simple\, right? In
  their quest to make the dish\, a series of brilliant and ridiculous event
 s occur\, including a supermarket strike in France\, a chicken-stealing-po
 lice chase\, and a watermelon fight. Rich with laughter\, and bursting wit
 h colour and calamity\, this story sparks an essential conversation about 
 grief and joy in childhood.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/fi

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 141 mins (2h21m)\nScreen: 1\n\nFrom the disturbing p
 sychological maze of Dogtooth to the crowd-pleasing fantasies of The Favou
 rite\, there is nothing quite like a Yorgos Lanthimos film. Featuring Emma
  Stone in one of her most revered roles to date\, Poor Things has taken th
 e festival arena by storm. After trying to take her own life\, Bella Baxte
 r (Emma Stone) is resurrected by an experimental Victorian anatomist. In t
 his comedic\, Frankenstein-esque tale\, Bella is awakened to a new life of
  European adventure and sexual discovery\, which celebrates self-explorati
 on and freakish delights in all their glory.\n\nAlso playing at:\n• Fri

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 90 mins (1h30m)\nScreen: 1\n\nFREE SCREENING! Once u
 pon a time\, in a far away swamp\, there lived an ogre named Shrek… and 
 animated cinema history was born. Packed with irreverence that turned the 
 fairy tale genre on its head\, this Dreamworks classic has a bevy of winni
 ng performances from the likes of Mike Myers\, Cameron Diaz\, and the inim
 itable Eddie Murphy\, a banging soundtrack – Smash Mouth’s ‘All Star
 ’ and the cover of ‘I'm a Believer’ are iconic – and a simple\, bu
 t heartfelt message on the importance of companionship. Add in the ambitio
 us CG stylisation and a consistent hit rate of gags\, and it’s little wo
 nder why Shrek still holds up two decades after we were first introduced t
 o his swamp.For more fun\, join us in the cinema restaurant an hour before
  each family screening for arts and crafts.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgefilmfe

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 90 mins (1h30m)\nScreen: 1\n\nNorwegian filmmaker Ma
 rgreth Olin has been working across the documentary form for three decades
 \, and yet her films always feel fresh and pertinent. For Songs of Earth\,
  she chose a rather personal approach: filming her mother\, and mainly her
  father\, as a guide to a most spectacular part of the Norwegian landscape
 \, the Oldedalen valley in Nordfjord. An extraordinary travelogue with epi
 sodes of contemplation dedicated to nature’s beauty across all seasons\,
  Songs of Earth pays tribute to a world that\, even for Norwegians\, will 
 always remain partly unknowable. The mysteries of life and death haunt the
 se profound landscapes\, while the music is composed of unique sound recor
 dings – nature's own melodies\, translated and performed by the London C
 ontemporary Orchestra.Part of Environment & Community\, supported by\n\nAl

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 86 mins (1h26m)\nScreen: 3\n\nMost directors start w
 ith something relatively small scale for their first film. Asif Kapadia is

  on Lafcadia (the late\, great Irfan Khan)\, a leader of warriors commande
 d by a cruel local lord who has a vision that inspires him to renounce his
  life of violence. But that’s easier said than done\, and soon the hunte
 r becomes the hunted. The cinematography by Roman Osin is frequently beaut
 iful\, and the old-fashioned\, visual-heavy storytelling is no less bold a

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 106 mins (1h46m)\nScreen: 2\n\nWe are thrilled to we
 lcome director Carol Morley to Cambridge for our 42nd Opening Night! Typis
 t Artist Pirate King is a touching tribute to Sunderland-born artist Audre
 y Amiss. Carol Morley takes us on a heart-warming road trip that captures 
 the memories\, locations and nostalgia that influenced Audrey’s art and 
 writing. The film first finds Audrey (Monica Dolan) going through the arch
 ives of her life’s work\, feeling driven to return home to put on a fina
 l exhibition. Her psychiatric nurse Sandra (Kelly Macdonald) gets roped in
 to the trip\, and they encounter strangers and new friends on the road.\n\
