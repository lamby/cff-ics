 e One of Eustache’s most radical experiments\, the formally and narrativ
 ely transgressive A Dirty Story presents two versions of the same event\,
  in which a group of women listen to a man describe his discovery of a pee
 phole in a women’s restroom. One is a “true” monologue delivered by 
 the actual participant (Eustache’s friend and collaborator Jean-Noël Pi
 cq)\; the other a staged recreation of Picq’s performance starring Micha
 el Lonsdale. Further muddying the waters between documentary and fiction\,
  Eustache preferred that the “fictional” version be shown first. Indiv
